Coloscopia was a DIY/punk art festival organised by arts students from several schools and different artistic disciplines.
Taking place in a decommissioned underground quarry in the region of Tours, it offered  visitors several kilometers of galleries to wander in and enjoy the installations and 
artworks scattered all across its dimly-lit tunnels.
<br><br>
I created two installations for the occasion :<br>
- a radio hacked to replace the stations with political speeches from different eras of the 20th century. It was placed deep into the quarry in order for visitors to  
hear it resonate from far away, giving an "out of time" atmosphere to a whole part of the tunnels;<br>
- a lone telegraph key, displayed on a table in a middle of a tunnel, which activated a strobe light hidden in a collapsed gallery nearby, illuminating a usually unlit and 
invisible area.
