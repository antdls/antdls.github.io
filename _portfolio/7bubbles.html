The very first interactive project I worked on; as part of the Audiovisual & Interactive Technologies class in my engineering school, we created an 
interactive installation which is a concerto of bubbles generated by passersby.
<br><br>
They can rotate and blow into two "straws" to create new bubbles on a screen. These virtual bubbles move and, upon collision with other bubbles, 
create musical sounds. Once they have reached the end of their lifespan, they move to the top of the screen and "get out", activating a bubble 
machine which gives physical existence to these virtual bubbles.
<br><br>
The straws are actually mic stands. The microphones mounted on them catch the passersby breath as sound, which the program uses to create bubbles.
