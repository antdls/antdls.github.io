A game created during a game jam at Les Gobelins. The theme of the jam was "cult movies". 
We were inspired by Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977) for its atmosphere and lighting and tried 
to reproduce the claustrophobic, disorienting experience lived by the movie's heroine. You can download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/suspirium">HERE</a>.
<br><br>
Players take control of woman/entity lost in a fixed camera environment, and has to figure out how to find and use abilities to "get out".
Our main influence was the original Alone In The Dark, with its awkard and unsettling fixed camera angles. The abilities gained while playing through the game are 
inspired by techniques used in Dario Argento's films : camera travelling, colorful and sudden light changes and moving decor.
