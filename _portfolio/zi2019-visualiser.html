TopographX is a software for iEEG data visualization. It can process and display formatted data extracted from electrodes located in patients' brains and create a 3D representation of it. 
<br><br>
It can also create files that can be read by a web player, in order to share results and act as figures in research papers and theses. An example of it can be found <a href="https://daphnerr.github.io/statchansActive50ms/index.html">HERE</a>
