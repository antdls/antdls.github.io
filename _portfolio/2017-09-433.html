A challenge to create a physical game based on the composition 4'33" by John Cage. This composition is a 3 movement piece which is entirely made up of silence. 
The idea we extracted from it was that of gathering people to create silence. Therefore, the game is about creating silence.
<br><br>
It's a game of bluff : you have to play musical notes card in the right order, in order to be the first to discard all your cards. The trick is the cards are always 
played face hidden, their value is just announced by the player. Any other player can call a bluff, if the card played was a wrong one, the player draws additional 
cards. There is no announcement when a silence card is played, and no announcement is allowed for any card afterward. If a player says anything during a silence, 
they have to draw cards. The silence can only be broken by calling a bluff.
