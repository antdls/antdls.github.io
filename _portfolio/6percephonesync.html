End-of-studies research project at my engineering school, the goal being to synchronise as much audio/video/data streams as possible. What we actually tried to do 
was to create a software and hardware system to synchonise data coming from Traktor turntables, video played by VJing software and sequences of scene lights animation.
<br><br>
We didn't manage to make everything work together, but we did create :<br>
- a system to control scene lights with just a computer, which we improved and later used on the 
<a href="https://antdls.github.io/interactive/2Gedeon/">Gedeon</a> project;<br>
- a link to control a video playback with Tratkor turntables, which gave a DJ the ability to do some scratching on the music and on the video at 
the same time.
