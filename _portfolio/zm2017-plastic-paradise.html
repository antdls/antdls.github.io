A jam game made during the <a href="http://www.g4ceurope.eu/animation-vr-mr-ar-videogames-for-impact/">Animation, VR/MR/AR & Videogames for Impact</a> 
event, organised by Games For Change Europe and The Animation Workshop in Viborg, Denmark. You can download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/plastic-paradise">HERE</a>.
<br><br>
The event was about how to use video games to enact positive change in urban communities and spread awaraness about ocean pollution. It ended with a one-day game jam with the 
theme : "Mind the ocean". With a team of three people we made a game about plastic pollution, in which the player takes control of a plastic bottle that has been 
thrown into the ocean.
<br><br>
The goal is to avoid being cleaned up by environmnetal activists or eaten by fish and reach the titular Plastic Paradise, the real-life 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch">Great Pacific garbage patch</a>. To do that players have the ability to move the bottle, and to 
decompose and recompose it. As plastic particles the bottle can go through fishing nets, but will be eaten by fish.
