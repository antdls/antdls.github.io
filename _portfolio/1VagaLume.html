One of our project's goals at <i>Les Gobelins</i> was to solve a problem for a museum belonging to the city of Paris. The Petit Palais is a 19th/20th century art 
museum, built for the Exposition Universelle of 1900. Its administration was looking for a way to get visitors interested in the building as much as in the works of art.
<br><br>
We designed a type of audioguide, a pod containing a "piece of memory" from someone visiting the building on its inauguration. In concrete terms, it is 
a box, containing a speaker and animated lights, which "speaks" with information points in the museum. The box represents a person speaking to various other 
characters such as the building's architect, a construction worker, a painter, and so on. These characters inform the visitors about interesting aspects of the 
building.
<br><br>
The main idea is to get visitors to look for these hidden information points by wandering around the building and searching for interesting parts of the 
architecture independently.
