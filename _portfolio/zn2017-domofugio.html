This was made for a narrative design and writing exercice during my studies. It's an interactive fiction/game about smart homes and remote surveillance.
<br><br>
It puts the player in the position of a woman using a smart home app, Domofugio, to check on her children at home while she's at work. When 
an intruder breaks into her home she ends up trapped in a desperate, voyeur-ish point of view of the events. The only way to have any 
influence on what's happening is through the smart home app and a text messages conversation with her kids.
<br><br>
There is minimal interaction to put the player in a helpless position and give the piece a dystopian, disturbing feeling. It was meant as a comment on the 
fake feeling of security and agency given by surveillance systems. 
You can download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/domofugio">HERE</a> (only available in French, sorry).
