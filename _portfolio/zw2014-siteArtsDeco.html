While working at a web and interactive design agency, I participated in the complete overall of the Arts Décoratifs museum's website. The goal of this overall was 
to get rid of an old, early 2000's design and replace it with a new responsive one, improving the navigation and meeting new technical standards.
<br><br>
Our main challenge was to highlight the most notable pieces of the museum's collections 
while also deal with the huge amount of media that needed to be displayed (photos, videos and sound). I personally worked on the pages presenting the collections and 
the visit and revamped the interactive map.
