Made for the Gothic Novel Jam in July 2018.<br>
We wanted to focus on exploring and the feeling of being lost and threatened.<br><br>

It's in a really unfinished state, with no end except death. We didn't test it much so it might be really hard (?). We didn't have time to implement the story either, though we're planning to complete it eventually.<br><br>

Story intro<br> 
You wake up in the middle of the night, disoriented. The light of your candle feels soothing. Once it fades, you sense a danger lurking in the dark. The shadows feel familiar, yet this makes you wary, not calm.<br><br>

Controls<br>
WASD : movement<br>
E : pickup objects/open doors<br>
Mouse left : attack<br><br>


Made with Basile Mathieur.<br>
