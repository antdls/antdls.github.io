A game prototype made for the Gothic Novel Jam in July 2018. You can download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/dahra">HERE</a>.
<br><br>

Inspired by gothic horror novels, we wanted to make a game in which players wander through a typical gothic manor while feeling lost and threatened. The game 
is seen in a top-down view, with only two sources of light : lightning from outside the manor and a waning candle held by the player character. The gameplay is 
about finding keys to open doors, while also keeping the candle lit to avoid being assaulted by ghosts.
<br><br>

This is really nothing more than a prototype, as it is in a really unfinished state with no end except death. We didn't have time to do a lot of tests so the difficulty 
isn't balanced. We didn't have time to implement the story either, though we're planning to complete it eventually.

Controls
<br>
WASD : movement
<br>
E : pickup objects/open doors
<br>
Mouse left : attack
