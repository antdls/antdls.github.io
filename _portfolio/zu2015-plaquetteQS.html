Building on our <a href="https://antdls.github.io/portfolio/zx2014-percephonesync/">end-of-studies project</a>, two friends and I created an interactive design 
agency, named Quaterside. Specialized in creating custom devices, software and installations, our aim was to make our expertise in new technologies and engineering 
available to artists, events and interior designers. We focused mainly on lighting.
<br><br>
We researched and produced a number of projects such as interactive lights synchronised to a band's instruments, control systems for giant LED screens (for 
architectural lighting), complete solutions for interactive retail spaces, software interfaces to control lights in concert venues and interactive lights for opera and ballets.
<br><br>
Acting as the graphic designer of the company, I made this brochure to present our different services and design philosophy. You can downlad a version 
of it <a href="https://antdls.github.io/assets/pdfs/Quaterside_Brochure_ev_09-15.pdf">HERE</a>.
