In 2014 the Château de Fontainebleau museum created a temporary exhibition to showcase a special piece of furniture from their inventory : an 
ebony <i>cabinet</i> from the 17th century, heavily decorated with engravings depicting the Odyssey and the life of Alexander The Great. 
<br><br>
This exhibition presented a challenge : the interesting aspect of the item is the details of its engravings but, due to preservation concerns, 
visitors could not approach it, and had to stay at least 2 meters away from it.
<br><br>
The solution we found was to add interactive tables around it, which visitors used to access an app with ultra high definition photos of the <i>cabinet</i>. These 
made it possible to browse and look at the detailed engravings even better than with the naked eye, while also being able to place them on the real item.
<br><br>
I programmed the app and worked on its design. It is available online (in French) <a href="http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/secretsdebene/index.html">HERE</a>. (Last checked November 2019)
