<br>
As part of Quaterside, the interactive design agency I co-founded, we were approached by a student organisation to create a cheap, easy-to-use and modular lighting 
solution for their events. 
<br><br>
We designed and built a set of LED tubes fully controllable with the Art Net protocol. The tubes are separeted in two independently controlled parts for maximum effect. 
The system is scalable (any number of tubes can be used), and can be placed and reconfigured according to the venue it is used in, each of the tubes having attachment points at 
each end.
<br><br>
For the first event, a series of parties at the Cabaret Sauvage venue in Paris, we designed an interface with 
animation and color presets. Those were controllable with an APC (a controller commonly used by DJs), 
with some customizable parameters such as speed, intensity, randomness, transitions and more.
<br><br>
I built the tubes, designed the control app's UX/UI, and created the lighting effects.
