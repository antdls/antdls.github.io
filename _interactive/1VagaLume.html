One of our projects' goal at <i>Les Gobelins</i> was to solve a problem for a museum belonging to the city of Paris. The Petit Palais is a 19th/20th century art 
museum, built for the 1900 World's Fair. Its administration was looking for a way to get visitors interested in the building as much as in the works of art.
<br><br>
We designed a kind of audioguide, a pod containing a piece of memory from someone's visit of the building during its inauguration. In concrete terms, it is 
a box, containing a speaker and animated lights, which "speaks" with information points in the museum. It represents someone, the box, speaking to various other 
characters such as the building's architect, a construction worker, a painter, and so on. These characters will inform the visitors about interesting aspects of the 
building.
<br><br>
The main idea is to get visitors to look for these hidden information points, wandering around the building and looking by themselves for interesting things in the 
architecture.
