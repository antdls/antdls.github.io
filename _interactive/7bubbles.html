The very first interactive project I worked on. As part of the Audiovisual & Interactive Technologies class in my engineering school, we created an 
interactive installation which is a concerto of bubbles created by passersby.
<br><br>
They can rotate and blow into two "straws" to create new bubbles on a screen. These virtual bubbles will move and, upon collision with other bubbles, 
will create musical sounds. Once they reached the end of their lifespan, they will move to the top of the screen and "get out", activating a bubble 
machine which will give a physical existence to these virtual bubbles.
<br><br>
The straws are actually mic stands. The microphones mounted on them will catch the passersby breath as sound, which the program will use to create bubbles.
