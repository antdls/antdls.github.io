We were approached by associations to create a cheap, easy-to-use and modular solutions for their 
events. We created from scratch a set of LED tubes, fully controllable with the Art Net protocol. The system is scalable (any number of tubes can be used), and can be placed and reconfigured according to the venue it is used in.
<br><br>
For the first events, a series of parties at the Cabaret Sauvage venue in Paris, we designed an interface with 
animation and color presets. Those were controllable with an APC (a controller commonly used by DJs), 
with some of their parameters customizable such as speed, intensity, randomness, transitions, etc.
