Arts students from several schools and different artistic disciplines came together at a very special location, an underground quarry close to Tours with several 
kilometers of galleries, used to display artworks and installations made for the occasion. The idea was to have visitors wander aimlessly underground, so that they could 
come across installations randomly.
<br><br>
I created two installations :<br>
- a radio, which was hacked to replace the stations with political speeches from different eras of the 20th century. It was placed in such a way that you could hear it from far away in 
the galleries, giving an "out of time" atmosphere to a whole part of the quarry;<br>
- a telegraph key, displayed alone on a table, which activated a strobe light hidden in a collapsed gallery nearby, therefore illuminating a usually unlit and 
invisible area.
