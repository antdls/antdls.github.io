The Château de Fontainebleau museum created a temporary exhibition to showcase a special piece of furniture : an ebony <i>cabinet</i> from the 17th century, decorated with engravings depicting the Odyssey and the life of Alexander The Great. The engravings were so fine, it was impossible to see the details without getting too close.
<br><br>
The museum then asked us to create interactive tables and an app, with which the visitors could zoom in on ultra high definition photos of the <i>cabinet</i>. This was used to link the engravings to their preparatory drawings, also shown at the exhibit.
<br><br>
The application is available online (in French) <a href="http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/secretsdebene/index.html">HERE</a>.
