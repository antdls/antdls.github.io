With several other associates, we created Quaterside in 2014. It was an interactive design agency specialised in creating custom devices and installations. The agency's goal was to give retail, communication and events businesses access to new technologies. 
Quaterside's objective was to bring interactivity to its clients' scenographies and spaces, while respecting their universe and artistic direction. We produced and researched a number of projects for bands, architects and artists. 
This is the brochure I made to present our different services and design philosophy.
