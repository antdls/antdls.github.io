While visiting the exhibition <a href="http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/exhibitions-and-events/at-the-museum/exhibitions/event-details/e/the-color-line-36687/">The Color Line</a>, I was struck by the powerful design of 
Aaron Douglas' paintings. I wanted to try my hand at this kind of techniques, and created a series of posters/flyers for a fictional lounge bar.
