A game made during the <a href="http://www.g4ceurope.eu/animation-vr-mr-ar-videogames-for-impact/">Animation, VR/MR/AR & Videogames for Impact</a> 
event, organised by G4C Europe and The Animation Workshop. You can 
download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/plastic-paradise">HERE</a>.
<br><br>
The theme was : "Mind the ocean". We decided to make a game about 
plastic pollution, but one that would try to inform players indirectly. 
Which is why you play as a plastic bottle thrown in the ocean.
<br><br>
The goal is to avoid being cleaned up by environmnetal activists or 
eaten by fishes and reach the plastic paradise, representing the 
so-called "Great Pacific garbage patch". To do that the player has to 
decompose and recompose the plastic bottle. As plastic particles, you 
can go through the fishing nets, but can also be eaten by the schools 
of fish.
