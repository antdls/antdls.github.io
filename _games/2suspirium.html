A student project created during a game jam at Les Gobelins. The subject being "cult movies", we chose Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977) for its atmosphere and lighting. 
We tried to reproduce the claustrophobic, disorienting experience of the movie's heroine.
<br><br>
Our main influence was the original Alone In The Dark, with its awkard and unsettling camera angles.
